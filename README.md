# **React Effects and Refs Exercise**

## **Part 1: Click to Draw**

Build an app that displays a deck of cards, one card at a time. When the page loads, go to the [Deck of Cards API](http://deckofcardsapi.com/) to create a new deck, and show a button on the page that will let you draw a card.

Every time you click the button, display a new card, until there are no cards left in the deck. If you try to draw when there are no cards remaining, an alert message should appear on the screen with the text “Error: no cards remaining!”.

**Our solution has some fancy CSS styling. The goal here is to focus on React and not CSS so please get the core functionality working and then get a code review. Do not focus on CSS at all for now.**

## **Part 2: Shuffle The Deck**

Add a button that when clicked, will shuffle the deck, so that you can start drawing from a full deck without refreshing the page. You’ll have to make a call to the cards api to shuffle the existing deck. The button should not be clickable while the shuffle is in progress. The shuffle should remove all of the cards from the screen.
